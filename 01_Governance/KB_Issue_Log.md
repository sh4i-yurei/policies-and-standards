# Purpose

Provide a local issue log for governed changes when no external tracker
is used.

# Scope

Use for issues related to KB governance, standards, workflows, and
templates. External trackers may be linked when used.

# Standard

## Issue log

Use the format defined in [issue_log_tpl](../06_Projects/Templates/governance/issue_log_tpl.md).

| Issue ID | Date opened | Title | Classification | Status | Owner | Links / Artifacts | Resolution date |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Entry rules

- Use one row per issue.
- Link affected documents and any decision artifacts.
- Close issues with resolution date and supporting links.

# Implementation Notes

- Keep entries brief; use links for full detail.
- If issues are tracked externally, record the external ID/link here.

# Continuous Improvement and Compliance Metrics

- Track issue count, cycle time, and closure rate.

# Compliance

Governed changes without an issue (or approved intent statement) are
non-compliant.
