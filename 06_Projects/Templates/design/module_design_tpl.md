# Purpose

Provide a structured Module Design template aligned to
[Module_Design_Standard](../../../04_Design_Framework/Module_Design_Standard.md). Use this to decompose an approved System
Design into a cohesive module definition.

# Scope

Use for any module, component, or service that maps to a System Design.

# Standard

## Module design template

Use this template to define one module that implements an approved
System Design. Keep scope tight and align to
[Module_Design_Standard](../../../04_Design_Framework/Module_Design_Standard.md).

## Module purpose and responsibility

Describe the single primary responsibility in business/system terms.
State what success looks like.

## Inputs and outputs

List all inputs the module consumes and outputs it produces, including
side effects.

## Public interfaces

Document APIs, events, CLI entry points, or other interfaces. Include
contracts (shape, types, error conditions).
Link schema definitions per [schema-definition-standard](../../../04_Design_Framework/schema-definition-standard.md) for
interface contracts and shared data shapes.

## Dependencies

List upstream modules, services, libraries, and data stores this module
relies on. Note trust boundaries and rationale.

## Internal responsibilities

Capture notable internal roles or subcomponents if helpful, without
specifying implementation.

## Error and failure modes

Identify expected errors, timeouts, retries, and how they are surfaced
or handled.

## Non-functional considerations

Performance, scalability, availability, observability, security,
privacy, or compliance constraints relevant to this module.

## Observability and signals

List logs, metrics, traces, and alerting expectations for this module.

## Constraints and assumptions

State assumptions from the System Design or environment. Include any
constraints that narrow implementation choices.

## Explicit non-responsibilities

Call out work this module will not do to prevent scope creep.

## Definition of done

- Aligned to approved System Design.
- Applicable sections of [Design_Review_Checklist](../../../04_Design_Framework/Design_Review_Checklist.md) completed.
- Observability signals identified and linked to owners.
- Links to related issues or specs captured.

## Links

- System Design: <link>
- Related ADRs: <list>
- Related specs: <list>

# Implementation Notes

- Keep this template focused on one module per document.
- Avoid implementation detail unless it clarifies intent.

# Continuous Improvement and Compliance Metrics

- Track module redesign frequency and boundary violations.

# Compliance

Module Designs missing required sections or review evidence are
non-compliant.
