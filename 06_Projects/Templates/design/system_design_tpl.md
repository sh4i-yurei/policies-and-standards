# Scope

Use for Tier 3 work and for any system-level design required before
module design or implementation.

# Implementation Notes

- Keep all required sections, even if marked N/A.
- Replace placeholders with project-specific details.

# Continuous Improvement and Compliance Metrics

- Track revision frequency and post-implementation corrections.

# Compliance

System designs that omit required sections are non-compliant.

# Changelog
