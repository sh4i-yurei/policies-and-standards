# Implementation Notes

- Keep requirements testable and avoid solution details.
- Use this PRD to seed the project charter and design artifacts.

# Continuous Improvement and Compliance Metrics

- Track requirement churn and downstream rework rates.

# Compliance

Tier 3 work without a PRD or equivalent requirements document is
non-compliant.
