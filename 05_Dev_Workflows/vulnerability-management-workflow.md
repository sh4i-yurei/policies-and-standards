# Purpose

Define how vulnerabilities are reported, triaged, remediated, and
validated to protect governed systems.

# Scope

Applies to all security findings, dependency advisories, and reported
vulnerabilities for governed projects.

# Standard

## Workflow steps

1. Intake: record the vulnerability using
   [vulnerability_report_tpl](../06_Projects/Templates/risk/vulnerability_report_tpl.md) with
   severity and affected components.
2. Triage: confirm impact, exploitability, and affected versions.
3. Plan: define remediation scope, tests, and rollout approach.
4. Fix: implement the change per approved specs and standards.
5. Validate: run required security and regression checks.
6. Release: follow [release_workflow](release_workflow.md) and document evidence.
7. Communicate: document status, disclosure plan, and follow-ups.

## Severity guidance

- Sev-1: active exploit or critical data exposure.
- Sev-2: high-impact vulnerability without active exploit.
- Sev-3: moderate or low-impact vulnerability.

## Definition of done

- Issue updated with remediation evidence and release details.
- Root cause and prevention notes recorded for Sev-1 and Sev-2.
- Follow-up actions tracked as new issues.

# Implementation Notes

- Coordinate with incident response for Sev-1 events.
- Record decision notes and approvals in Quint artifacts when required.
- Use the vulnerability report template to standardize intake and
  remediation evidence.

# Continuous Improvement and Compliance Metrics

- Track time-to-remediate by severity.
- Review recurrence and dependency advisory trends.

# Compliance

Vulnerabilities without tracked remediation and validation are
non-compliant.
